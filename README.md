# ManagingHospitalAntibioticResistance

We created a cycle visualizer to help hospital and or public health officials graph and find optimal antibiotic cycles to use for their specific area. 

Users are able to input data as a susceptibility/resistance matrix of antibiotics and calculate and graph ideal antibiotic cycles.
